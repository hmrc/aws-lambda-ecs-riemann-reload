# aws-lambda-ecs-riemann-reload

[![Brought to you by Telemetry Team](https://img.shields.io/badge/MDTP-Telemetry-40D9C0?style=flat&labelColor=000000&logo=gov.uk)](https://confluence.tools.tax.service.gov.uk/display/TEL/Telemetry)

An AWS Lambda that will re-deploy the Riemann consumer or producer services running in ECS, when triggered by an SNS notification.
The SNS notification is in turn triggered by an alarm configured to look at when the Kafka agent running in Riemann is (unexpectedly) stopped.

Please check the [telemetry-terraform](https://github.com/hmrc/telemetry-terraform) repository for details on how this Lambda is deployed.

## Requirements

* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release)
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

## Quick start

```shell
# Install correct version of Python
pyenv install $(cat .python-version)

# Optional set up environment variables
export POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT=true
export PYTHONPATH=/home/james/hmrcDev/aws-lambda-ecs-riemann-reload
export MDTP_ENVIRONMENT=integration

# Run tests:
make test

# Package the lambda locally:
make package
```

### Environment variables
The following environment variables are processed by the lambda handler and can therefore be set in Terraform to
